<h3>Title</h3>
<p>RoboWorld: where can my robot work?</p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The behaviour of a robot affects and is affected by its environment.  So, many of the expected and desirable properties of a robotic system depend on properties of its environment. While a complete model of that environment is very difficult, if not impossible, to construct, we can realistically capture assumptions about the environment.  In this talk, we present RoboWorld, a controlled natural language with a process-algebraic semantics that can be used to define (a) the operational requirements of a robot, and (b) how the
robot interacts with its environment.  RoboWorld is part of the RoboStar framework of domain-specific languages that support proof, simulation, and testing of robotic systems. RoboWorld plays a central role in all these forms of verification.</p>
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Ana Cavalcanti (University of York) is Professor of Software Verification and Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies working on Software Engineering for Robotics: modelling, validation, simulation, and testing. She currently leads the RoboStar research group at the University of York. She held a Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit Award and a Royal Society Industry Fellowship to work with QinetiQ in avionics. She has chaired the Programme Committee of various well-established international conferences, is on the editorial board of four international journals, and is Chair of the board of the Formal Methods Europe Association. Her current research is on theory and practice of verification and
testing for robotics.</p>
